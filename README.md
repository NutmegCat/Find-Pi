# **Finding Pi**
<br></br>
## Objective
---
<br>

- The diagram shows a unit square in the Cartesian plane and a quarter circle of radius one, centred at the origin.
  - Show that, if a point is chosen at random within the square, the probability that it will also be inside the quarter circle is π / 4.


  - Write a program that repeatedly generates the coordinates of a random point within the square and determines whether or not the point also lies inside the quarter circle. The program should repeat the process 10 000 times. After every 1 000 repetitions, it should use the results to determine and print an estimate of the value of π (based on all repetitions up to that point).

- Has In.java
- Used Java version 1.2 ~~(*is updated though*)~~
